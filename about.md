I am a physicist, data scientist and machine learning enthusiast currently working as a process engineer at Intel.

I conducted my graduate research as a member of Prof. Andrew Mugler's [research group](http://www.physics.purdue.edu/mugler/home.html) at [Purdue University](http://www.physics.purdue.edu/).
For my thesis dissertation I studied phenomena related to single and multicellular chemotaxis using computational tools and mathematical models. The research problems were primarily related to how noise and fluctuations in a cell's microenvironment limit its ability to chemotax, and how collective cell behavior can improve chemotactic performance. My thesis can be found on [Purdue's library website](https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/dissertations/AAI10641410/) and [on my github](https://github.com/varennes/thesis).

Here is a link to my [resume](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JPewVovPV52Y9IgzJ4LJZtkIuXs1ohM6), and my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jvarennes/). Please reach out if you would like to view a more up-to-date resume. You may also check out my [github page](https://github.com/varennes) to view the simulation code I developed for my research as well as hobby data science projects.
