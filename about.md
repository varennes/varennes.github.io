Hello!

I am a physics Phd student at [Purdue University](http://www.physics.purdue.edu/). I have been studying and working at Purdue since August 2013. 

### More Information

I am interested in biophysics. I am currently working on problems of collective cell sensing and how that pertains to diffusion.

You can find my old blog [here](http://12biophys.blogspot.com/). I eventually plan to migrate all of those posts to this site.
