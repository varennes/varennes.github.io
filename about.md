I am a physics Phd student at [Purdue University](http://www.physics.purdue.edu/) and I work in Prof. Andrew Mugler's [research group](http://www.physics.purdue.edu/mugler/home.html).

I study phenomena in the field of biophysics. I am interested in problems pertaining to collective cell sensing and how that affects cell migration.

Here is a link to my [brief cv](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9wUAi2m2Di9SHY0eHloX2hZM3M). You may also check out my [github page](https://github.com/varennes) to view some physics simulation projects I am working on.
