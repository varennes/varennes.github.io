Hello!

I am a physics Phd student at [Purdue University](http://www.physics.purdue.edu/). I have been a graduate student at Purdue since August 2013 and I work in Prof. Andrew Mugler's [research group](http://www.physics.purdue.edu/mugler/home.html).

### More Information

I work in the field of biophysics. I am interested in problems pertaining to collective cell sensing and how that affects cell migration.
