# Feedforward Loop

Recall the different types of feedforward loops. Last lecture we discussed the behavior of the *C1* loop. The advantage of the *C1* loop is that it protects *Z* from turning on due to fluctuations in *X*. This is called a *persistence detector*.

Now we will examine the behavior of some of the incoherent feedforward loops.

## *I1* Loop

Assume that the signals from *X* and *Y* combine in an *AND NOT* logic fashion to create output *Z*.

| Transcription Rate | *X* | *Y* |
|:--|:-:|:-:|
| $0$  | $0$  | $0$  |
| $0$  |  $0$ | $>0$  |
| $k$  | $>0$ | $0$  |
| $k'<< k$  | $>0$  | $>0$  |

As in the previous lecture, assume that the concentration of *X* quickly turns on at time $$t=0$$.

$$ y(t) = y^* \left( 1 - e^{-r_yt} \right) $$

$$z(t) = \begin{cases}
  z_\text{max} \left( 1 - e^{-r_zt} \right) , & t < \tau \\
  z^*+(z_y-z^*)e^{-r_z(t-\tau)}, & t > \tau
\end{cases}
$$

$$
\tau = \frac{1}{r_y}\ln\left( \frac{1}{1-K/y^*} \right) \\
\frac{z^*}{z_\text{max}} = \frac{k'}{k} = \frac{1}{F} \\
F \equiv \text{Repression Factor}
$$

$$ \tau_{1/2} =  \frac{1}{r_z}\ln\left( \frac{2F}{2F-1} \right) \\
\tau_{1/2} = \begin{cases}
0, & F>>1 \\ \frac{1}{r_z}\ln 2, & F = 1
\end{cases}$$

In summary, there are three ways to speed up response.

1. Auto-repression
2. Incoherent *feedforward loop*
3. Increase the degradation rate *r* and increase the production rate *k*.
