**All motors rectify thermal motion.**
To make a [molecular motor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_motor) its potential energy $$U(x)$$ needs to have one of the two following properties.

1. $$U(x)$$ is modulated in time. That is to say the potential energy is somehow turned on and off.
2. $$U(x)$$ is modulated in space. The potential energy is repeatedly altered through space.

The first scenario is how one-headed motors work. The second scenario is how two-headed motors work.

## Single Headed Motors

Two ingredients go into making a single headed motor:

1.  Asymmetric potential in space.
2.  Potential that switches on and off with time.

### Speed and Efficiency

Assume that the potential has an asymmetric saw-tooth shape. 
The length of one saw-tooth is $$d$$ and the length of the steeper half of the saw-tooth is $$\alpha d$$. Let the maximum potential be $$U_\text{max}=\mathcal{E}$$, and let $$kT<\mathcal{E}$$. After a time $$\Delta t$$ the potential will turn off.

 - Initially motor is in a potential minimum.
 - After the potential is turned off the motor can freely diffuse for a time $$\Delta t$$ until the potential turns back on.

$$ \sigma_x^2 = 2D\Delta t$$

We know that the position probability distribution for 1D diffusion will be Gaussian. To make things simple on ourselves lets assume that the distribution is triangular.

$$
2w = \text{width of triangle} \\ A = \text{height of triangle} \\
\Rightarrow P(x) = A\left(1-\frac{\vert x\vert}{w}\right) \\
P(x) = \frac{1}{w}\left(1-\frac{\vert x\vert}{w}\right)
$$

**Note**: $$P(x)$$ must be wide enough to go into both neighboring saw-tooth minimums to get any useful results.

$$ w \geq \max\left(\{(1-\alpha)d, \ \alpha d\}\right)$$

The width $$w$$ is a parameter set by the motor while $$\alpha$$ and $$d$$ are set by the actin filament the motor crawls on.

We can calculate the variance in position.

$$
\sigma^2 = \left<x^2\right>-\left<x\right>^2=\left<x^2\right> \\
\sigma^2 = \int_{-w}^{+w}dx \ x^2\frac{1}{w} \left(1-\frac{\vert x\vert}{w}\right) \\
\sigma^2 = \frac{w^2}{6} \\
\Rightarrow 2D\Delta t = \frac{w^2}{6}
$$

Lets calculate the probability that the motor will move to the notch on the right.

$$
P_R= \int_{\alpha d}^{w}dx \ \frac{1}{w} \left(1-\frac{\vert x\vert}{w}\right) \\
P_R= \frac{1}{2}\left(1-\frac{\alpha d}{w}\right)^2 
$$

The probability to move to the left will then be...

$$ P_L = \frac{1}{2}\left[1-\frac{(1-\alpha) d}{w}\right]^2 $$

The probability that the motor makes net forward motion is then the difference between these two probabilities.

$$ P_\text{net}=P_R-P_L \\ P_\text{net} = \frac{(1-2\alpha) d}{w}\left(1-\frac{d}{2w}\right) $$

Let's check some limits to make sure that this answer makes sense.

$$\begin{align*}
\alpha \to1 &: P_\text{net}\to -\frac{d}{w}\left(1-\frac{d}{2w}\right) \\
\alpha\to 0 &: P_\text{net}\to \ \frac{d}{w}\left(1-\frac{d}{2w}\right) \\
\alpha\to\frac{1}{2} &:P_\text{net}\to0
\end{align*}$$

#### Optimal $$w$$

For simplicity let $$y\equiv\frac{d}{w}$$. In order to find the optimal width we will take the derivative of the net probability with respect to $$w$$.

$$
0 = \frac{dP_\text{net}}{dw} \Leftrightarrow \frac{dP_\text{net}}{dy}=0 \\
0 = (1-2\alpha)(1-y) \\
\Rightarrow w^*=d
$$

This corresponds to a maximal net probability.

$$P_\text{net}^* - \frac{1}{2}-\alpha$$

A realistic value for $$P_\text{net}$$ for microtubules is $$P_\text{net}\approx 1/10$$. Using this we can calculate the net velocity of the motor.

$$ v = \frac{d \ P_\text{net}}{\Delta t}=\frac{d \ P_\text{net}}{d^2/12D}=\frac{12DP_\text{net}}{d} \\
v \sim 1 \mu\text{m/s}
$$
