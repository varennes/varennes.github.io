title: Sense and Sensitivity

[Prof. Andrew Mugler](http://www.physics.purdue.edu/mugler/) and I wrote [a review](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.5b00899) on cancer metastasis from a physics perspective. Using simple physical models the limits to metastatic cells' sensory capabilities can be understood, and experimental evidence that cells operate near these limits is reviewed. Models of collective cell migration are surveyed in order to understand how collective metastatic invasion can occur. We conclude by applying our physics understanding to cancer therapies.

The review was published to [ACS Molecular Pharmaceutics](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.5b00899), and a pre-print can be found  [here on the arxiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00496).

I also talked about my experience writing a review with the fine people at Scholastica, and you can [read about it here](http://blog.scholasticahq.com/post/142019663558/getting-published-in-an-academic-journal-for-the). I talked about the logistics of writing a review and my experience submitting a manuscript for the first time.
