Research I conducted in conjunction with [Prof. Andrew Mugler](http://www.physics.purdue.edu/mugler/) and [Prof. Bumsoo Han](http://www.biotransportgroup.org/) has been published today in Biophysical Journal. The paper, [Collective Chemotaxis through Noisy Multicellular Gradient Sensing
](http://www.cell.com/biophysj/fulltext/S0006-3495(16)30523-9), examines how cell-cell communication can enable a cluster of cells to successfully migrate in response to chemoattractant. This work was motivated by recent experiments which show that clusters of cells can chemotax in response to signals too weak for single cells to detect. We develop a model which aims to explain how clusters can detect such weak chemical signals and in turn use that information to direct their motion.

The paper was published to [Biophysical Journal](http://www.cell.com/biophysj/abstract/S0006-3495(16)30523-9), and a video of an exemplary simulation from our study was featured on the front page of their website. A pre-print of the article can be found [here on the arxiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.00712). The [source code](https://github.com/varennes/collective-chemotaxis-cpm) for the simulations conducted for this study is freely available on GitHub.
