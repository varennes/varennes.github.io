# Network  Motifs

We have already examined the one node motif of auto-regulation, let's now explore 3 node motifs.

Let $$n$$ be the number of nodes and $$g$$ be the number of edges. For a 3 node motif $$n=3$$ and the number of edges can vary from 2 all the way to 6.

## Random Network

What are our expectations for a random network with $$N$$ nodes and $$E$$ edges? Let's try to figure out the expected number of sub-graphs of a particular type, $$\bar{s}$$.

### Calculate $$\bar{s}$$

First, we need to choose $$n$$ nodes from a total of $$N$$.

$$ \binom{N}{n}  = \frac{N!}{n!(N-n)!} \approx \frac{1}{n!}N^n$$

Knowing this, what is the probability of choosing the desired edge placements?

$$
p \approx \frac{1}{N}\frac{1}{(N-1)!}E(n!) \approx \frac{1}{N^2}n! E \\
\bar{s} = \binom{N}{n}p^g \\
\Rightarrow \bar{s} \approx \left( \frac{En!}{N^2} \right)^g \left(\frac{1}{n!}N^n \right)
$$

Assuming as $$N$$ increases the ratio $$E/N$$ remains fixed.

$$ \lambda \equiv E/N = \text{constant} $$

$$ \bar{s} \sim \left( \lambda \frac{1}{N} \right)^g N^n = \lambda^gN^{n-g} $$

For a 3 node, $$n=3$$ motif this yields the following results. 

| *g*  | $$ \ \ \ \ \ \bar{s}$$  |
|:-:|:-:|
|  2 | $$\sim N $$  |
|  3 | $$\sim N^0 $$  |
|  6 | $$\sim N^{-3} $$  |

In the case of $$g=3$$ the number of sub-graphs does not change $$N$$ varies. Two different sub-graphs in this category are the *feedback loop* and the *feedforward loop*. In the picture below, the sub-graphs in the center represents a *feedback loop* and the sub-graph on the right is a *feedforward loop*.

Compared to the expected number of sub-graphs in a random network, feedforward loops are very much over-represented in E.coli.

# Feedforward Loop

There are 8 distinct types of feedforward loops. Half of them are incoherent and the other half are coherent.

Let's examine the behavior of the Coherent type 1 loop (*C1*).

## *C1*  Loop

Assume the concentration of *X* is quickly turned on at time $$t=0$$.

$$
y(t) = y^* \left( 1 - e^{-rt} \right)  \\
K = y^*\left(1- e^{-r\tau} \right) \\
\Rightarrow \tau = \frac{1}{r} \ln\left(\frac{1}{1-K/y^*} \right)
$$

### AND Logic

Assume that the signals from *X* and *Y* combine in an *AND* logic fashion to create output *Z*.

- There is a time delay $\tau$ between *X* turning on and *Z* turning on.
- There is no time delay between *X* turning off and *Z* turning off.

### OR Logic

Assume that the signals from *X* and *Y* combine in an *OR* logic fashion to create output *Z*.

- There is no time delay between *X* turning on and *Z* turning on.
- There is a time delay $\tau$ between *X* turning off and *Z* turning off.

Time delays between changes in *X* and changes in *Z* may be useful for suppressing noise.
