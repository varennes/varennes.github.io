# Self-Avoiding Chain
 - A self-avoiding chain is a freely jointed chain the does not cross over itself.
	 - One of the first scientists to work on this problem is [Flory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Flory).
 - We want to quantify how the chain avoids crossing itself. This is done by examining the free energy of the chain.

## Free Energy Discussion: $$F=E-TS$$
We need expression for the energy and the entropy of the self-avoiding chain.

 - Approximate the entropy as that of the FJC.
 
 $$ \rightarrow S = k\ln P(r) + \text{const.} = k \left(-\frac{3r^2}{2Nb^2} \right) + \text{const.} $$

 - Energy term will be used to penalize crossing over.
	 - Consider a single monomer $$i$$ (link) along the chain.
		 - Assign an energy penalty for having non-neighboring monomers near the monomer $$i$$.

$$ E_i = kT(\text{# of other monomers around}) $$

- Let this number be described by the density of monomers $$\rho$$ multiplied by some small volume $$V$$ that encloses the monomer $$i$$.

$$ 
\Rightarrow E_i = kT(\rho V) = kT \left( \frac{3N}{4 \pi r^3} V \right) \\
\Rightarrow F \approx kTN\frac{3NV}{4\pi r^3} + kT\frac{3r^2}{2Nb^2}
$$

We want to minimize $$F$$ with respect to $$r$$ to figure out the optimal size of the chain.

$$
0 = \frac{\partial F}{\partial r} = \frac{3N^2V}{4\pi} \frac{-3}{r^4} + \frac{3r}{Nb^2} \\
\rightarrow r^2 \approx \left(\frac{3}{4\pi}\right)^{2/5} N^{6/5} (b^2V)^{2/5}
$$

This is an important result! For the self-avoiding chain $$\left<r^2\right> \propto N^{6/5}$$ whereas for the other models $$\left<r^2\right> \propto N$$.

# Aside: DNA
DNA behavior is well predicted by that of a worm-like chain. We know the following for a worm-like chain:

$$ \sqrt{\left<r^2\right>} = r_{\text{RMS}} = \sqrt{Nb(2\xi)} $$

Lets examine the RMS length of DNA from different organisms.

 - [**Lambda Phage**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_phage)
 ![lambdaphage](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Phage_lambda_virion.svg/375px-Phage_lambda_virion.svg.png)
	 - $$ N \approx 50,000 $$ ;  $$ R \approx 30nm $$
		  $$ r_{\text{RMS}} \approx 1300nm $$
	  $$ r_{\text{RMS}} >> R $$
 -  [**E Coli**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli)
 ![ecoli](http://www.nature-education.org/cell-ecoli.jpg)
	 - $$ N \approx 4.6 \cdot 10^6 $$ ;  $$ R \approx 0.5\mu m $$
		  $$ r_{\text{RMS}} \approx 13\mu m $$
	  $$ r_{\text{RMS}} >> R $$
 - [**Human Cell**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote#Animal_cell)
![humancell](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Animal_cell_structure_en.svg/525px-Animal_cell_structure_en.svg.png)
	 - $$ N \approx 3.3 \cdot 10^9 $$ ;  $$ R \approx 3\mu m $$ (Cell Nucleus)
		  $$ r_{\text{RMS}} \approx 300\mu m $$
	  $$ r_{\text{RMS}} > R $$

In each case the RMS length of the DNA is much bigger than the size of it's enclosing cell structure. Single cell organisms like Lambda Phage and E Coli take care of this by having very hard cell walls to keep DNA enclosed at a high pressure. In human cells however, the nucleus walls of very weak. Tight packing of DNA into [chromosomes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome) ensures that the DNA to remains contained in the nucleus.

## Concluding Remarks about Polymers
The MSD distance of a polymer always has behaves like something of the form:

$$ \left<r^2\right> = Nb(2\xi) $$

 - If $$\xi<<Nb$$ then the polymer is floppy and dense.
 - If $$\xi>>Nb$$ then the polymer is straight and stiff.


# Lipids

[Lipids](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid) are molecules found in cells and one of their functions is to group together forming cell membranes. Consists of a head and a tail. The head is hydrophilic - attracted to water - while the tail is hydrophobic - repelled by water.

![lipidex](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/Phospholipids_aqueous_solution_structures.svg/331px-Phospholipids_aqueous_solution_structures.svg.png)
An example of the different kind of groupings lipids can make.

## Do Lipids Always Self-Assemble into Membranes?

There is a trade off between lipids being spread apart or grouped together like in membranes.

 - **Free Lipids**
	 - High entropy
	 - High energy
 - **Grouped Lipids**
	 - Low entropy
	 - Low energy

### Free Energy Discussion

Hypothesis: lipids transition from free to grouped when $$E \approx TS$$.

We can quantify the energy of a single lipid assuming that it has an approximately cylindrical shape as:

$$
E_1 = \gamma (2\pi R \ l) \\
\gamma = \text{surface tension}
$$

For free lipids, we can approximate the entropy of a single lipid as that of an ideal gas particle.

$$
S = k \ln Z + \frac{\bar{E}}{T} \\
\bar{E} = \text{average energy} \\
Z = \frac{Z_1^N}{N!} \\
Z_1 = \frac{1}{h} \int dx \ dp \ e^{-\left(p^2/2m\right) / kT} = \frac{1}{h} L \sqrt{2\pi m k T} \\
\text{let } \lambda \equiv  \frac{h}{\sqrt{2\pi m k T}} \\
\Rightarrow Z_1 = \frac{L}{\lambda} \\
$$

For an ideal gas the average energy $$\bar{E} = \frac{3}{2}kTN$$. Now lets put this all together to calculate $TS$, the energy at which we hypothesized free lipids will group together.

$$
\ln Z = 3N \ln Z_1 - \ln N! \\
\rightarrow \ln Z = N \left[ \ln\left(\frac{L^3}{\lambda^3 N}\right) + 1 \right] \\
\text{let } \rho \equiv N/L^3 \\
\ln Z = N \left[-\ln\left(\lambda^3\rho\right) + 1 \right] \\
\Rightarrow TS = kTN \left[-\ln\left(\lambda^3\rho\right) + 5/2 \right]
$$

This final expression above is the transition energy. Lets find the corresponding density $\rho$ where the transition occurs. 

$$
\text{let  } NE_1=TS \\
\rightarrow 2\pi N\gamma R \ l = kT N \left( 5/2 - \ln \lambda^3 \rho \right) \\
\ln\lambda^3\rho = \frac{5}{2} - \frac{2\pi\gamma R \ l}{kT} \\
\text{let } l_0 \equiv \frac{kT}{2\pi\gamma R \ l} \\ 
\Rightarrow \rho_c = \frac{1}{\lambda^3} e^{5/2} e^{-l/l_0}
$$

So the prediction is that $$\rho_c \propto e^{-l/l_0}$$ where $$l$$ is the length of the lipid's chain. It turns out that this corresponds to very low critical densities. Therefore, even at low lipid density they easily start packing together.
