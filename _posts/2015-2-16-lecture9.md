## Flagellum Propulsion

### What is the efficiency of the flagellum?

![flagella](http://sweetium.com/images/labimages/bacterium.png)

We are interested in calculating the efficiency of the flagellum as a means of propulsion for the bacteria. Efficiency is defined as the following:
$$ \mathcal{E} \equiv \frac{\text{minimum power needed to drag the body}}{\text{power supplied by the motor}} \\  
\mathcal{E} = \frac{F_\text{drag}v}{\tau\omega_0} \\
\mathcal{E} = \frac{(Bv)v}{(d\omega)\omega_0}
$$
Last lecture we derived 3 equations as well as an approximate form for $v$ which we will use to simplify our expression for $\mathcal{E}$.
$$
\mathcal{E} = \frac{Bv^2}{d\omega_0\left(\frac{B+b}{c}\right)v} \\
\Rightarrow \mathcal{E} = \frac{Bc^2}{d(B+b)^2}
$$

Parameters $B, b, c, d$ are different effective drag coefficients and they all depend on the relative size of the body to the flagellum.

### What is the most efficient size regime?

Efficiency depends on relative size. First lets set some *shape parameters* of the flagellum. *Shape parameters* depend solely on the characteristics of the flagellum (i.e. helicity, diameter). Let $\ b_0, c_0, d_0 \ $ be these shape parameters. We can relate the shape parameters to the drag coefficients in the following way:
$$
b = \alpha b_0 \\
c = \alpha^2 c_0 \\
d = \alpha^3 d_0 \\
\alpha \equiv \text{dimensionless scaling factor}
$$

Now we can write $\mathcal{E}$ in terms of $\alpha$ and we can take the derivative of $\mathcal{E}$ with respect to $\alpha$ to maximize the efficiency.
$$
\Rightarrow \mathcal{E} = \frac{B\alpha^4 c_0^2}{\alpha^3 d_0(B+\alpha b_0)^2} \\
0 = \frac{d\mathcal{E}}{d\alpha} = \frac{Bc_0^2}{d_0}
\frac{(B+\alpha b_0)^2 - 2\alpha b_0 (B+\alpha b_0)}{(\text{ . . . })}
$$
Simplifying the above equation leads to an expression for $\alpha^*$, the value for $\alpha$ at which the efficiency is maximized.
$$
\alpha^* = \frac{B}{b_0} \\
\Rightarrow b^* = B
$$
We see that the efficiency is maximized when there is equal drag on the body and the flagellum.
$$ \mathcal{E}_\text{max} = \frac{c_0^2}{4d_0b_0} $$
This is a very interesting reslt because it does not depend on size! It only depends on the **relative shape** of the flagellum.

## Dynamics of Filament Polymerization

### Simple Microtubule Model

![microtubule](http://www.bioon.com/book/biology/mboc/chapter16/figure16-23.gif)

In our discussion we will consider a microtubule radiating from a centrosome. Monomers diffusing around the microtubule may bind to the microtubule and become a filament along the length of the tubule. Lets define some quantities of interest in order to describe to growth of the microtubule.
$$
c = \text{ concentration of monomers} \\
\alpha = \text{ attach rate} \\
\mu = \text{ detach rate}
$$
The concentration, $c$, has units of number per unit volume. $\alpha$ and $\mu$ has units of inverse time. There is an obvious relationship between $c$ and $\alpha$, if the concentration goes up so will the attach rate. We will assume that the two quantities are proportional to each other and define the *on rate*, $k$, as that factor.
$$
\alpha = kc \\
k \equiv \text{ on rate}
$$
On the other hand, we will assume that the detach rate is constant and not a function of concentration.
$$ \mu \neq f(c) $$

### Rate Equation

The rate equation describes the change in the number of filaments $n$ in the microtubule.
$$
\frac{dn}{dt} = \alpha - \mu = kc - \mu
$$
As with the case of the detach rate, we will assume that the number of filaments is not a function of concentration.
$$
n \neq f(c) \\
\Rightarrow n(t) = (\alpha - \mu)t + n_0
$$
Notice that when $\alpha=\mu$, $n(t)=\text{constant}$. We can solve for the corresponding concentration of monomers for when this occurs and its known as the *critical concentration* $c^*$.
$$ c^* = \frac{\mu}{k} $$

#### $\frac{dn}{dt}$ Phase Space

If we plot $\frac{dn}{dt}$ as a function of $c$ we notice the following:
$$
c<c^* \ \Rightarrow \ \frac{dn}{dt}<0 \\
c>c^* \ \Rightarrow \ \frac{dn}{dt}>0
$$
This divides the microtubule dynamics into two phases. When $c<c^*$ the tubule shrinks, and when $c>c^*$ the tubule grows.

## Polymerization at Both Ends

We can also imagine a model where the tubule is not connected to a centrosome on one end. In this case the microtubule can grow and shrink at both ends. We denote one side as the "$+$" side and the other as the "$-$" side.
$$
\frac{dn_+}{dt} = \alpha_+-\mu_+
\frac{dn_-}{dt} = \alpha_--\mu_-
$$
In this case there are two critical concentrations, $c^*_+$ and $c^*_-$.

Microtubules are known to have roughly the same critical concentrations.
$$ c^*_- \approx c^*_- $$
In this case the phase space will be the same as before. When $c<c^*$ both sides shrink and when $c>c^*$ both sides grow.
